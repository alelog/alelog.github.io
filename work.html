      I am the Vice President of Research at
      <a href="https://www.grammatech.com/">GrammaTech</a>, a leading
      cyber-security technology company.  At GrammaTech, I oversee
      both technical and business aspects of the Research Division.</p>
      
    <p>My research work at GrammaTech has focused on binary-analysis
      technologies, including both formal and heuristic techniques.
      A key contribution of my early work at GrammaTech was the addition
      of <a href="https://www.grammatech.com/products/binary-analysis">
      Binary-Analysis Capabilities</a> to
      <a href="https://www.grammatech.com/products/codesonar">CodeSonar</a>.
      In recent years, work in my division began to explore statistical,
      machine-learning, and evolutionary-computation techniques in an
      effort to address the challenges of scalability and precision in
      program analysis and repair.</p>
      
    <p>I received a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the University of
      Wisconsin, where my thesis exposed a new connection between
      machine learning and program analysis.  Before joining GrammaTech,
      I worked at Hewlett-Packard and the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.</p>
